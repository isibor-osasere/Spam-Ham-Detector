## Overview

The SpamHam-Detector aims to provide a robust solution for identifying spam emails. This project leverages NLP techniques to preprocess email text and utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify the emails.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization)

- Feature extraction using TF-IDF

- Classification using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest

- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpamHam-Detector.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SpamHam-Detector
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled email messages. Each email is labeled as either "spam" or "ham". This dataset can be gotten from kaggle.

## Model
The project employs various machine learning algorithms for classification. The preprocessing and feature extraction steps are essential for transforming the raw email text into meaningful features.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
